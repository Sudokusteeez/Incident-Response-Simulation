# Incident-Response-Simulation-

This repository contains a Python script for simulating a basic Cybersecurity Incident Response scenario using SimPy. The simulation models an Incident Response Team handling incidents reported in real-time.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase practical skills in simulating cybersecurity incident response scenarios. It demonstrates an understanding of simulation tools, such as SimPy, and their application in modeling real-world incident response processes.

Key Features
Simulation Setup: The script configures the number of analysts, average incident resolution time, and incident reporting interval to create a realistic incident response environment.

Incident Response Team: The simulation defines an IncidentResponseTeam class, which models the behavior of a team of analysts resolving incidents.

Incident Generation: The script generates simulated incidents and assigns them to the Incident Response Team for resolution.

Realistic Incident Time: Incident resolution times are modeled using a random distribution to simulate realistic variations in response times.

Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming: The code is written in Python, showcasing proficiency in this programming language, and its application in cybersecurity simulations.

SimPy Library: The project utilizes SimPy, a discrete-event simulation library, to model the incident response scenario, demonstrating knowledge of simulation tools.

Random Number Generation: The simulation generates random incident resolution times to simulate real-world variations in response times, highlighting the use of random number generators in simulations.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required libraries by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install simpy numpy
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

Run the simulation using the command:

Copy code
python incident_response_simulation.py
The simulation will execute, and the output will display incident details and the number of incidents resolved during the simulation.

Note
This simulation serves as a basic representation of incident response activities. For a more sophisticated model, additional elements, such as different incident types, varying analyst skill levels, and more complex workflows, can be incorporated.

Please feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvements.
